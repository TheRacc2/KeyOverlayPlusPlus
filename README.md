## Installation

Once downloaded from the [releases](https://github.com/TheRacc2/KeyOverlayPlusPlus/releases/tag/v1.0) page, it's as simple as doubleclicking!

## Source Code

This project is open source, free to use and modify.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheRacc2/KeyOverlayPlusPlus
```

**You will need to modify the *freeglut* and *glew* paths in Visual Studio**

## Usage

The first time the application is opened, it will generate a **config.json** file. All values containing "color" are **Hexacedimal RGBA** values converted to decimal.

When adding to OBS, select **Add Source->Game Capture** and click **Allow Transparency**. Simply select the window and you're good to go!
